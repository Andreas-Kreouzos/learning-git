# Git and Github Course

Continuing my journey in becoming a software engineer, the knowledge of GitHub is a necessity that had to tackle as soon as possible, and during my search on Internet for courses on this topic, I saw the [Amigoscode Git & GitHub Course](https://amigoscode.com/p/git-github). I gave it a go and I immediatelly appreciated the way that Nelson provided his knowledge to anyone that follows the path of software engineering as me.
